🛍️ ZARA Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
📌 Project Overview

This project performs Customer Segmentation for ZARA using K-Means clustering.
The goal is to group customers based on spending behavior, income, promotions usage, and shopping frequency, helping identify high-value customers, discount seekers, loyal shoppers, and more.

Businesses like ZARA can use these insights to deliver targeted marketing strategies, personalized offers, retention campaigns, and product recommendations.

🎯 Business Objectives

Segment customers based on behavior and purchasing patterns

Understand characteristics of each group

Generate business insights from clusters

Recommend marketing strategies tailored to each segment

Prepare final summary report with visualizations


📂 Project Workflow (Week-wise)
📅 Week 1: Data Loading, Cleaning & EDA

✔ Load ZARA dataset

✔ Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers

✔ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis

✔ Scale and encode features


🧪 Week 2: Clustering & Visualizations

✔ Applied K-Means Clustering

✔ Determined optimal K using Elbow and Silhouette Methods

✔ Performed PCA for dimensionality reduction

✔ Visualized clusters using scatter plots and PCA plots

✔ Assigned cluster labels


🧠 Week 3: Cluster Profiling & Insights

✔ Analyzed characteristics of each cluster

✔ Generated human-readable insights

✔ Identified behavioral patterns (e.g., high spenders, deal hunters, loyal customers)

✔ Extracted traits like income level, promotion usage, spending score, and shopping frequency


📊 Week 4: Final Summary Report & Marketing Strategy

✔ Created Final Cluster Summary Table

✔ Added Heatmaps and Scatter Plots

✔ Suggested marketing strategies for each segment

✔ Prepared final customer segmentation report


📈 Sample Final Cluster Summary Output

Cluster	Key Traits	Behavioral Insights	Recommended Strategies

0:	High Income, High Spending	Brand loyal, premium shopper	Promote exclusive offers & VIP memberships

1: Low Income, High Promotion Use	Price-sensitive, deal-focused	Offer discounts, bundles, cashback

2:	Moderate Income & Frequency	Balanced shoppers	Personalized recommendations.

🚀 Key Insights

Premium customers show high spending but low promotion usage — ideal for loyalty programs.

Deal-sensitive shoppers respond well to discounts and festive campaigns.

Moderate-value customers can be converted to high-value buyers using targeted incentives.


🔮 Business Impact

✔ Personalized Marketing

✔ Targeted Promotions

✔ Customer Retention

✔ Higher ROI on Campaigns

✔ Strategic Decision Making


📌 Future Enhancements
